<B>NOTE!! THIS IMAGE IS DEPRECATED. We will no longer be making updates or rebuilding this image. The Dockerhub endpoint will stay online with the current tags for this software.</B>

This container is Minecraft, McMyAdminall-in-one. It combines all of these applications into one container and consequently takes a little while to start up.

## Minecraft
Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.

## McMyAdmin
is the leading web control panel and administration console for Minecraft servers, trusted by over 75000 server admins and more than 35 different service providers.
